## Get Started
Install dependencies in your project directory with:
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can then run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br>

### `npm run dev-build`

Builds a non-minified build.
